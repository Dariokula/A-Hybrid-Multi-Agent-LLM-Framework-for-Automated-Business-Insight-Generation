Do NOT interpret them as \"end date\" or \"end schedule deviation\" unless the user also\n  asks about lateness/deviation/deadlines/end timestamps (e.g., \"late\", \"delay\", \"deviation\", \"deadline\",\n  \"planned vs actual end\", \"completion date\").\n- It is still allowed to keep a filter column in the selection IF it is needed for the output:\n  - the user explicitly asks to show it, or\n  - the user asks for a breakdown/grouping \"by/per/nach <column>\", or\n  - the analysis type requires it (segmentation, grouping, comparison).\n\nRules:\n- Only choose columns that exist in df_profile.schema.dtypes.\n- Keep the selection small (default max 12 unless clearly necessary).\n- If time-based analysis is requested, include a suitable time column (see df_profile.roles.time_candidates).\n  - If multiple time columns exist (planned vs actual; start vs end), choose deliberately:\n    - Prefer ACTUAL over PLANNED when the user does not specify.\n      Typical production naming: actual = ist_start/ist_ende (or actual_start/actual_end), planned = plan_start/plan_ende (or planned_*).\n    - Decide START vs END based on the analysis intent:\n      - Trend/forecast of outcomes (e.g., completion, lateness, cycle time realized at finish) -> prefer END.\n      - Analyses about starts (late starts, start adherence, WIP introduction) -> prefer START.\n- If the user asks \"by/per/nach <category>\", include that category column (see df_profile.roles.label_candidates).\n- Avoid ID columns unless explicitly needed.\n\nReturn STRICT JSON only:\n{\n  \"columns\": [\"colA\",\"colB\",...],\n  \"rationale\":\"<1-2 sentences>\",\n  \"confidence\":0.0-1.0,\n  \"signals\":[\"...\",\"...\"]\n}\n",

A \nproduction order can consist of multiple operations. The data includes p lanned dates, actual \ndates, planned work quantities, actual labor times, and various schedule deviations (TA).  \nData fields  \n• pps_order_id: Unique ID of a production order  \n• pps_order_pos_id: Unique ID of the operation within the order (one order consists of \nmultiple operations)  \n• resource_group: Operations are executed on specific machine groups / resource groups \n(e.g., CNC milling, drilling machines)  \n• plan_start: Planned operation start (date, day -level granularity)  \n• ist_start: Actual start (date, day -level granularity)  \n• plan_ende: Planned end (date, day -level granularity)  \n• ist_ende: Actual end (date, day -level granularity) (if available)  \n• status: Operation status (e.g., “in progress”, “finished”)  \n• avg_type: Operation type (drilling, milling, assembly, etc.), more specific than \nresource_group  \n• ist_dlz: Cycle time (in days), compu",

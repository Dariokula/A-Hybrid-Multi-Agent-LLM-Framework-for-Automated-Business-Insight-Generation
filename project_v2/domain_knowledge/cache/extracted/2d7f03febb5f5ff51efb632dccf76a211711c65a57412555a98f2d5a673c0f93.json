{"path": "domain_knowledge\\sources\\pdf\\domain_knowledge_dataset.pdf", "text": "deepIng intern  Short description of the data (domain view)  \nGeneral context: The data describes production operations in a manufacturing environment. \nEach row represents a single operation (e.g., drilling, milling) within a production order. A \nproduction order can consist of multiple operations. The data includes p lanned dates, actual \ndates, planned work quantities, actual labor times, and various schedule deviations (TA).  \nData fields  \n• pps_order_id: Unique ID of a production order  \n• pps_order_pos_id: Unique ID of the operation within the order (one order consists of \nmultiple operations)  \n• resource_group: Operations are executed on specific machine groups / resource groups \n(e.g., CNC milling, drilling machines)  \n• plan_start: Planned operation start (date, day -level granularity)  \n• ist_start: Actual start (date, day -level granularity)  \n• plan_ende: Planned end (date, day -level granularity)  \n• ist_ende: Actual end (date, day -level granularity) (if available)  \n• status: Operation status (e.g., “in progress”, “finished”)  \n• avg_type: Operation type (drilling, milling, assembly, etc.), more specific than \nresource_group  \n• ist_dlz: Cycle time (in days), computed as ist_ende minus ist_start  \n• ta_zugang: Start schedule deviation (TA  for Terminabweichung ) (in days), computed as \nist_start − plan_start; positive = start occurred later than planned  \n• ta_abgang: End schedule deviation (TA  for Terminabweichung ) (in days), computed as \nist_ende − plan_ende; positive = end occurred later than planned  \n• ta_rel: Lead -time deviation (in days) from planned to actual lead time, computed as \nta_abgang − ta_zugang; positive = lead time was longer than planned  \n• ta_status: Indicates whether the operation ran with schedule deviation (“mit TA”) or \nwithout schedule deviation (“ohne TA”)"}
